        </ul>

        <h4>Chicken Pasta</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 lb. penne pasta (uncooked)</li>
            <li>15 oz. fire roasted diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 oz. cream cheese</li>
            <li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Steps-->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Cut the chicken into 1/2 to 3/4 inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, pour the Cajun seasoning over the top, and stir to coat the chicken in spices.
            </li></p>
    
            <p><li>Add the olive oil and butter to a large deep skillet. Heat the oil and butter over medium-high until the skillet is very hot and the butter is melted and foamy.</li></p>

            <p><li>Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet and cook for a couple minutes on each side, or just until the outside gets some color. The chicken does not need to 
            be cooked through at this point.</li></p>

            <p><li>Add the diced yellow onion to the skilled and continue to saute' for about 2 minutes more, or just until the onion begins to soften. Allow the moisture from
            the onion to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
            </li></p>

            <p><li>Next, add the pasta, fire roasted tomatoes (with the juices), and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir until everything is evenly combined, then place a 
            lid on top and allow the broth to come to a boil.
            </li></p>

            <p><li>Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the pasta simmer for about ten minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is thick and <strong><em>saucy</em></strong>.</li></p>

            <p><li>Add the cream cheese to the skillet in chunks, then stir until it has melted into the sauce.</li></p>

            <p><li>Top the pasta with sliced green onions and serve!</li></p>
        </ol>
